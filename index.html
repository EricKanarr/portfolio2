        <p><h2>Hi!</h2> I'm Eric Kanarr, a full-stack developer that recently graduated from
           <a href="https://www.theironyard.com/coding-courses/web-development-career">The Iron Yard. </a>
           My past experience has been in finance working for enterprise companies.
           My roles included time in customer service, risk-management, data trending,
           and financial planning where I obtained my series 7 and 66 licenses.
           I have a passion for problem solving and working in an agile-based team
           environment.  When I'm not coding I enjoy cooking, fishing and attending sporting events.
           Feel free to shoot me an email or reach me on linkedin!</p>

            <h3>Recipe Box</h3>
            <p>This is an application that allows a user to register or log-in to a profile
                and create new recipes or edit previously saved ones.
                The recipe and user log-in info is stored in a PostgreSql database and hosted
                on Heroku.  This was built with Ruby on Rails.  </p>
